# Project Pitch 2017-07-17

- Summary:  
Based on real-estate data from the National Association of Realtor, this project will analyze the data on listings availability and cost per ZIP Code, across the US.  
Data Source: http://research.realtor.com/data/inventory-trends/  
The goal is to visualise the changes in real-estate prices across the country since 2012.  
The main visualisation will be a map coloured according to the pct change between 2012 and 2017 (second choice: the map will be connected with a slider and re-drawn to showcase pct or total value changes Q-to-Q or Y-to-Y).  
Other visualisations should include charts from aggregated data of avg listing prices and/or availability on county or state level.  
There should also be a search box that will allow users to search for their ZIP code of interest and check what the fluctuations of the real-estate prices are there.  
On a secondary level the real-estate data could be tested against income, or race data per ZIP Code to explore should there are correlations between real-estates prices, and ethnicity or income groups concentrations in ZIP codes.
