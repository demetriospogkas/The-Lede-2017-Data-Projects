Starting the second project for The Lede 2017. I will be exploring the proximity of fast food restaurants to schools in New York City, and how that correlates with youth obesity rates.  

NYC is actually not really known for having an obesity problem, rather a lot of people seem to be excercising, so I might have to shift focus on a state or city that has a more sizeable obesity problem.

For the time being I'm building store locations for NYC, and will see how it goes.
